Add the of_find_i2c_device_by_node function.

Add the of_find_i2c_device_by_node function. This allows you to follow
a reference in the device tree to an i2c device node and then locate
the linux device instantiated by the device tree. Example use, an i2s
codec controlled by i2c.

This was waiting for Anton's i2c patches that were just added.
