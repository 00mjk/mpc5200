AC97 driver for mpc5200

AC97 driver for mpc5200

I've implemented retries for when the AC97 hardware doesn't reset on
first try. About 10% of the time both the Efika and pcm030 AC97 codecs
don't reset on first try and need to be poked multiple times.  Failure
is indicated by not having the link clock start ticking. Every once in
a while even five pokes won't get the link started and I have to power
cycle.
